              <h1 id="about-contents">I love watching movies. But with all the movies available, sometimes finding my next favorite movie is a time consuming challenge that invovles multiple tabs. Social proof is a valuable way for me to gauge the potential enjoyment of a film, and I spend a lot of time on IMDB and reading reviews. So I had the idea to make a dashboard that can pull up that information with a single search.

            When thinking of the idea for my API hack, I struggled to find something that I personally found useful. I knew I could always do something related to the weather, but as someone who never bothers to check the weather myself, it seemed unappealing. Luckily there was a an unofficial IMDB Api available, and the New York Times recently made an API available for movie reviews. Unfortunately the IMDB Api works intermittently, so I'm sorry if you catch it on a bad day.

              Surprisingly, what I enjoyed most about this project was getting over my procrastination to learn to enjoy CSS. Many developers I know, experienced and beginner alike, dislike CSS and find it challenging. After finding some color palette resources online, my interest in color theory has been reactivated! Now I'm just excited to get better at making my programs look good. </h1>
